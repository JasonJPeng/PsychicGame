UCLA Project W2 - Guessing the character, play against the computer

You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially. The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 

Guess what letter the computer thinking of?
Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

You can guess uo to 10 times to win !
